/*Write a program to take two numbers as input and print their difference if the first number is greater than the second number otherwise print their sum.

Input:
First line will contain the first number (N1)
Second line will contain the second number (N2)
Output:
Output a single line containing the difference of 2 numbers (N1âˆ’N2) if the first number is greater than the second number otherwise output their sum (N1+N2).*/
